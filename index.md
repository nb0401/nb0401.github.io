## Python (& Tableau)

---

[Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis](https://github.com/nb0401/Data-Analytics-Course/tree/main/4.%20Project%20-%20Python)<br>
#### Challenge<br>
Using a dataset from an online grocery store, the goal was to gain new insights about customer sales pattern and their order behaviour with Python and Jupyter.<br>
#### Action<br>
After cleaning and merging multiple datasets, a variable system was created to sort all orders into 512 possible customer profiles out of which 509 existed, 26 of them were responsible for 1/3 of all orders. The patterns of this selection were compared with the whole dataset to find out the key differences of a high ordering profile.<br><br>

#### Result<br>
With these insights, the high ordering customers could be advertised more efficiently. Furthermore, these customer groups give opportunity to raise them into more frequent customers, potentially increasing the earnings.<br><br><br>

[Metabolites in the Wastewater](https://github.com/nb0401/Data-Analytics-Course/tree/main/5.%20Project%20-%20Open%20Data%20Project)<br>
#### Challenge<br>
In this open data project, the goal was to analyze the drug consumption situation in Europe during the pandemic, using datasets of metabolites in the wastewater. Furthermore, the correlation of specific drug consumption relationships was observed.<br>
#### Action<br>
After cleaning, merging, and a descriptive analysis, the drug consumption combinations with the highest correlation were further analyzed and tested. At this point, due to data limitations, the dataset had to be synthetically enhanced. Finally, the relationship of specific drug consumption behaviours was analyzed, to gain insights about possible synergy effects, useable to minimalize overall drug consumption.<br><br>

#### Result <br>
With the newfound insights, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the drug consumption could be observed. Looking at the correlations between the drug consumption combinations, the fight against drug abuse has to be viewed as a whole project, and not as an individual conflict for each drug.<br><br>

## SQL (& Tableau)

---

[Rockbuster Stealth LLC - Online Video Rental](https://github.com/nb0401/Data-Analytics-Course/tree/main/3.%20Project%20-%20SQL)<br>
#### Challenge<br>
Working with PostgreSQL, a dataset of an online movie rental service was analyzed with the goal to gain insights about the inventory performance and the customer base.<br>
#### Action<br>
Starting with the cleaning of data and a basic descriptive analysis, using SQL, the movie categories were ranked by popularity and earnings. Furthermore, the countries with the most profits were ranked and further analyzed to gain the insights needed for the management board. Lastly, a Tableau presentation was created to communicate the found facts.<br><br>

#### Result<br>
With the newfound insights, the movie inventory can be reduced and optimized with popular categories. Additionally, countries with already high earnings per customer can be further advertised to increase the earnings or the existing customer base.<br><br>

## Excel (& Tableau)

---

[MedCo - Preparing for Influenza Season](https://github.com/nb0401/Data-Analytics-Course/tree/main/2.%20Project%20-%20Tableau)<br>
#### Challenge<br>
Helping a medical staffing agency which provides temporary workers to hospitals and clinics on an on-need basis, my goal was to perform an analysis on past clinical data helping developing a staffing plan for the upcoming influenza season in the US.<br>
#### Action<br>
Multiple datasets were cleaned, wrangled, and merged using Excel. Using the demographic information provided, a high risk population was identified. Observing the spread of this high risk population and previous influenza deaths a staffing plan was created, based on these two KPIs. The calendar weeks in which the staff support is needed was identified using past data.

The staffing plan sorted the states into three priority groups. Due to the limitations of the data a risk assessment for every state was excluded.
#### Result<br>
Finally, recommendations regarding the staffing plan were provided, taking in account the high risk population across the US and the number of influenza deaths. With this the staff for the upcoming influenza season can be distributed accordingly.<br><br>

[GameCo - Finding future potential](https://github.com/nb0401/Data-Analytics-Course/blob/main/1.%20Project%20-%20Excel/First_Project.pdf)<br>
#### Challenge<br>
As an analyst for a fictional video game company, my goal was to execute a descriptive analysis of a video game data set. In short, finding insights to better the companyâ€˜s understanding of how new games perform in the decreasing market.<br>
#### Action<br>
Using Excel a first overview about the situation at whole was created. After finding the most popular video game genres in the global market, the situation for these genres was observed. The most promising genre in terms of units sold per count of published title could be identified.<br>

#### Result<br>
With the new information recommendations were phrased. Due to decreasing overall sales it is important to redefine the marketing budget and to focus on opportunities for future profit. The  facts provided by the analysis gave an answer to each topic.
