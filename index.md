[Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis](https://github.com/nb0401/Data-Analytics-Course/tree/main/4.%20Project%20-%20Python)<br>
#### Challenge<br>
Using a dataset from an online grocery store, the goal was to gain new insights about customer sales pattern and their order behaviour with Python and Jupyter.<br>
#### Action<br>
After cleaning and merging multiple datasets, a variable system was created to sort all orders into 512 possible customer profiles out of which 509 existed, 26 of them were responsible for 1/3 of all orders. The patterns of this selection were compared with the whole dataset to find out the key differences of a high ordering profile.<br><br>

#### Result<br>
With these insights, the high ordering customers could be advertised more efficiently. Furthermore, these customer groups give opportunity to raise them into more frequent customers, potentially increasing the earnings.<br><br><br>


[Metabolites in the Wastewater](https://github.com/nb0401/Data-Analytics-Course/tree/main/5.%20Project%20-%20Open%20Data%20Project)<br>
#### Challenge<br>
In this open data project, the goal was to analyze the drug consumption situation in Europe during the pandemic, using datasets of metabolites in the wastewater. Furthermore, the correlation of specific drug consumption relationships was observed.<br>
#### Action<br>
After cleaning, merging, and a descriptive analysis, the drug consumption combinations with the highest correlation were further analyzed and tested. At this point, due to data limitations, the dataset had to be synthetically enhanced. Finally, the relationship of specific drug consumption behaviours was analyzed, to gain insights about possible synergy effects, useable to minimalize overall drug consumption.<br><br>

#### Result <br>
With the newfound insights, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the drug consumption could be observed. Looking at the correlations between the drug consumption combinations, the fight against drug abuse has to be viewed as a whole project, and not as an individual conflict for each drug.<br><br><br>
