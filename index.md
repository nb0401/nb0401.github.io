[Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis](https://github.com/nb0401/Data-Analytics-Course/tree/main/4.%20Project%20-%20Python) <br>
#### Challenge<br>
Using a dataset from an online grocery store, the goal was to gain new insights about customer sales pattern and their order behaviour with Python and Jupyter.<br>
#### Action<br>
After cleaning and merging multiple datasets, a variable system was created to sort all orders into 512 possible customer profiles out of which 509 existed, 26 of them were responsible for 1/3 of all orders. The patterns of this selection were compared with the whole dataset to find out the key differences of a high ordering profile.<br><br>

#### Result<br>
With these insights, the high ordering customers could be advertised more efficiently. Furthermore, these customer groups give opportunity to raise them into more frequent customers, potentially increasing the earnings.<br>
